## Approach:

* Examine the HTML's structure: Recognize the HTML layout of university data on the webpage.

* Retrieve data: To obtain the HTML content of the university page for each state, use requests.

* Compile HTML: To find and extract the required data (name, logo, location, social media), use BeautifulSoup.

* Handle edge cases: Ensure that missing data or pagination is handled appropriately.

* Format data into JSON: Structure the extracted information into JSON format, printing or saving it as required.
